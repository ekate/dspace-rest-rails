The Center fosters East European area and language studies at OSU by seeding positions, supporting lectures, and funding language courses.  In addition to this, CSEES has an outreach program that extends throughout the state of Ohio and the Midwest, working with K-12 schools, community colleges, and other universities throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

    &quot;introductoryText&quot;: &quot;&lt;p&gt;As part of its effort to promote civil and informed debate on important social and political issues, and to bring together researchers and students from across the University, the nascent &lt;a href=\&quot;http://ethicsandhumanvalues.osu.edu/\&quot;&gt;OSU Center for Ethics and Human Values (CEHV)&lt;/a&gt; is planning a biennial series of “year-long, University-wide conversations” called &lt;a href=\&quot;http://compas.osu.edu/\&quot;&gt;“Conversations on Morality, Politics, and Society” (COMPAS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The COMPAS program aims to demonstrate how the University’s comprehensive intellectual resources can be aligned along their ethical dimension in order to help solve some of the serious problems confronting us. In doing so, we hope not only to establish a new, more expansive model for a university ethics center, but to show how ethical concern provides a basis for productive exchange on complex social issues among researchers from diverse fields, and between the University and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;COMPAS programs will enrich the research of scholars and the education of graduate and undergraduate students at OSU, and demonstrate the value of the University as a model of civil, informed discourse. The first in this ambitious program is the &lt;a href=\&quot;http://compas.osu.edu/immigration/\&quot;&gt;Immigration COMPAS&lt;/a&gt;, in the 2011-2012 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

    &quot;introductoryText&quot;: &quot;&lt;p&gt;The faculty and students in the School of Earth Sciences investigate the history of our planet, its material structure and resources, and the processes that have driven its evolution and continue to shape our environments. We study the Earth’s interior and surface, its oceans, freshwaters and glaciers, its atmosphere and outer space, and their interactions with each other and with the biosphere. We are concerned with the responsible utilization of natural resources, issues of sustainability, as well as the mitigation of natural and man-made hazards and global change. We read Earth’s recent and ancient history in its rocks, fossils, landscapes, and its gravity. We probe and characterize the Earth system using satellites, in-situ and laboratory measurements, physical theories, and numerical models. We conduct field work worldwide from Antarctica to the Arctic and from coral reefs to mountain peaks. Our scientific activities and interests span an enormous range of temporal and spatial scales. We create and disseminate knowledge about our planet, develop new techniques to explore and understand it, and share this knowledge and our technical skills with our colleagues, our students, and society.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt; The former name of this community was the Department of\r\nGeological Sciences, the name was officially changed on July 7,\r\n2006.

By combining the research power of CJRC\r\nwith the expertise of OICBP, the IEJ will work with criminal\r\njustice practitioners to identify and disseminate knowledge\r\npertinent to the development and implementation of sound policies\r\nand practices. The IEJ will also work with the academic community\r\nto identify gaps in research that can be translated into a best\r\npractices blueprint for practitioners. These activities will help\r\nto ensure that programming, decision making and policy\r\nimplementation are aligned with what research concludes are best\r\npractices, thereby, increasing the effectiveness in serving the\r\nacademic research community, policy developers and the\r\nimplementation community.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

Landies died suddenly after the fourth issue, and I\r\ncontinued it until 2005, publishing exciting, outrageous, and\r\nunacceptable writing, art, and unclassifiable materials that I\r\nconsidered beautiful and vitally important. They were also\r\nmaterials that no one else would publish.

Phase 1 of site development, which featured construction of\r\ntwo 2.5-acre deep-water marshes and a river water delivery system,\r\nwas completed in 1994. Phase 2 which involved establishing the\r\ninfrastructure for research and education of the site, including\r\nadditional wetlands, experimental microcosms, and a visitors&#39;\r\nwetland pavilion, was completed in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

Also\r\nincluded are applications of molecular spectroscopy in related\r\nfields such as physics, chemistry, atmospheric science, astronomy,\r\nremote sensing and so on.
